    # ActiveRecord 6.0 introduced multiple database support. With that, an update
    # has been made in https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/35089 to ensure that
    # all query caches are cleared across connection handlers and pools. If you
    # write on one connection, the other connection will have the update that
    # occurred.
    #
    # This broke ARHP which implements its own pool, allowing you to access
    # multiple databases with the same connection (e.g. 1 connection for 100
    # shards on the same server).
    #
    # This patch maintains the reference to the database during the cache clearing
    # to ensure that the database doesn't get swapped out mid-way into an
    # operation.
    #
    # This is a private Rails API and may change in future releases as they're
    # actively working on sharding in Rails 6 and above.
